# Details, details.

This is a feature test and polyfill for the HTML5 `details`/`summary` markup pattern, with a couple of extras:

* Allows you to expand and collapse the `details` content above/below specified screen sizes
* Adds keyboard navigation and toggling
* Adds a bunch of ARIA goodness

It should be noted that <a href="http://github.com/mathiasbynens">mathiasbynens</a> has an especially robust jQuery-based <a href="https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-details">test/polyfill</a> for this markup, as well.

Updates to come, and <a href="http://wil.to/det/">here is a demo</a>.
